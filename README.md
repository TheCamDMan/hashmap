# Hashmap

## Description

This program is an implementation of a HashMap class using provided skeleton code.

The methods that I have programmed are as follows:  
put()  
get()  
remove()  
contains_key()  
clear()  
empty_buckets()  
resize_table()  
table_load()  
get_keys()  

These are common HashMap operations that should be self evident in their function. More explanation can be found in the docstrings of the functions.

### How to Use

This program is meant to be used at the command line using class methods. Once the program is installed on your system, run the python file to see a
demonstration of the functions that I have written.

## Installation

1.  Download the files from the respository.
2.  Run the hash_map.py file to see a demonstration of the HashMap at the command line.

## Background

This program was assigned to me during Data Structures as a portfolio project during my time at Oregon State University while pursuing my
Bachelor's of Science in Computer Science.

This project uses instructor provided skeleton code and an imported file that emulates a LinkedList and DynamicArray. Our goal was to
use our understanding of data structures to implement the functions listed above.

## Version

### v.1

This is the first publicly released version of this program.

---

## Framework Used

This program is written entirely in Python.

## Credits

Portfolio Project for Oregon State University. Skeleton code and imported module were provided by the instructor.
